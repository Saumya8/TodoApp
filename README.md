Challenge Overview

Objective: Build a small web application that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a To-Do list, where each item consists of a task name and associated description.

Requirements

Front-end:

Create a user interface with a form to add new items to the To-Do list.
Display the list of items.
Provide options to edit and delete items.
Back-end:

Develop an API to handle CRUD operations.
Use a JSON file or other simple method for data storage.
Specifications

Front-end:

Use a modern framework/library of your choice, or any other technology you feel comfortable with.
Ensure the UI is responsive and user-friendly.
Validate the form inputs.
Back-end:

Use a back-end framework and language of your choice.
Implement RESTful endpoints, one for each of the following tasks:
Retrieve all items.
Create a new item.
Update an existing item.
Delete an item.
Handle possible errors (e.g., item not found).
Instructions

Setup and Dependencies: * Provide a brief setup guide for both front-end and back-end * List required dependencies and how to install them.

Development: * Implement the back-end API. * Develop the front-end interface to interact with the API.

Testing: * Test the API endpoints using a tool like Postman or curl. * Ensure the front-end interacts correctly with the back-end.

Please include the setup guide in this Coderpad submission, and submit the code files to opportunities@pyxer.ai before the end of the time limit.
